https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Sensors/MOD-IR-TEMP/open-source-hardware

Configurable corrections on Temperature

warn on fast raising values, next to MQ135 (temperature, CO2, VOC, Pressure)

implement use case: warn on indoor temperatures


## Battery

Assignee: Felix

implement use case: low battery warning

proper Bat impl https://github.com/svartalf/rust-battery/issues/96


## Nextcloud Analytics

Assignee: Markus

publishing data to [Nextcloud analytics](https://github.com/Rello/analytics/wiki/API#data-add)


## Code Smell

Assignee: Jannis

replace thread spawning and sighandling with async calls

optional/to be discussed: make properly distributed, replace ssh code

ping should be always on the same time

also end alarm mode (instead of ogg123 invocation)

better error handling


## PV

Assignee: Markus

implement all error codes

dump all registers

warn if battery `< 30%`

switching off heat pump if no sunshine (MOD-2 relay)


## Robustness

Assignee: Felix

Writing to SD-Card should be reduced as much as possible, read-only as much as possible

close garage door on reboots (needs up to 2x 10 sec wait)

Buttons and Environment without hardware (i.e. mock): https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-i2cdev/blob/master/examples/nunchuck.rs


## Olimex

Assignee: Felix

Bring basic functionality running on hardware

Write release/blog post about outcome of bachelor thesis


## Elektrification Improve Spec

Assignee: Florian

cmd-line arguments, env variables in `files/opensesame.spec`

make nice TOML sections in config files (set via spec)



## Improve Elektra Binding

Assignee: Jannis

allow async

allow generic serialization with specializations (e.g. for bool) maybe using serde https://serde.rs/data-format.html?) (get rid of get_bool and get_hash_map_vec_u8)

important tasks of https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/4411 (to be prioritized)

(optional, effort to be discussed:
	better support for arrays in TOML https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/4988
	fix hanging bug: https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/4981
	)


## Ansible

Assignee: Max/Jannis

put ~/.config into git

default editor not working

also install opensesame (via repo)

/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf

	"pcm.front cards.pcm.front" must be updated to "pcm.front cards.pcm.default"

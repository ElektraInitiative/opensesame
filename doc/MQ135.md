# Calibration

Actually not needed for latest approach (which only detects differences).

# SNS-MQ135

require 5V (±0.1)
Heater Resistance: 33Ω±5%
Heating consumption less than 800mw

measured for 12x SNS-MQ135: 8.9W
0.041A (41mA)

Related humidity less than 95%Rh


analog output is 0-5V
the digital output is frequency related to the output value¹ -> wrong
You can also use this sensor to get digital output from this pin, by setting a threshold value using the potentiometer.²

Note that when sensor are power up they need about 1 minute to settle, in this time the heater heats up the sensor. 


MQ-135 detects well Isopropile alcohol, Lighter gas


    400ppm – 750ppm: Good for health
    750 ppm – 1200 ppm: Take care
    1200 ppm (and above): Harmful to health³


# Possibilities to connect

ATmega16U4: 12-channels, 10-bit ADC
MOD-IO: 4-channels, 0-3.3V 10bit, needs 3.3V shifter
MOD-IO2: 4-channels (1, 2, 3, 5), also needs 3.3V shifter

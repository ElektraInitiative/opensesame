## Scenarios

- **Precondition:** 
	- The user has configured Opensesame to use Clima-Sensor-US and to publish to Opensensemap.
	- The [web interface of Opensensemap](www.opensensemap.org) is properly configured, and the corresponding IDs are entered in Elektra.
- **Main Success Scenario:**

	- When the outdoor temperature is above or equal 35째C OR 30째C and no wind, a heat warning is sent via Nextcloud chat.
	- Once the outdoor temperature drops below 20째C, the warnings are canceled in the Nextcloud Chat.
- **Error scenario:**
	- Unable to read register value; return the error to Nextcloud chat.
	- Connection to Opensensemap API fails; retry connection to Opensensemap at least once; return error to the Nextcloud chat.

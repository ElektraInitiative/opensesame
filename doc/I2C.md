# Important

- larger AC loads (>>10W) might need snubber circuits
- larger DC loads might need a diode
- avoid switching relays faster than every ~200ms
- avoid snubber parallel to switch on small loads
- avoid multiple appliances that might create interferences on the same board (i.e. connect larger loads to different mod-io2)
- snubber as near to load as possible

If all of this fails, reduce the I2C speed by activating the overlay using `sudo olinuxino-overlay` after installing Opensesame or manually with the file:
f3988a26e10c7b7f472284635a041c7e  i2c_2_clock_freq_6000_overlay.dtbo
(adding /usr/lib/olinuxino-overlays/sun7i-a20/i2c_2_clock_freq_6000_overlay.dtbo to `fdtoverlays` in `/boot/uEnv.txt` or use `sudo olinuxino-overlay`)
